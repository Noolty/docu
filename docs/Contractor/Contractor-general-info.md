# General Info

Everyone playing on the Global Cargo servers is starting as a contractor.
You can stay a contracter if you want but its also able to grow to your own farm.

Contracters can help out farmers by doing Contracts or doing exports. Contracters are not allowd to do things on farms if there is not a contract or export open for it.



## Earn your money

As sayed above you can grow to your own farm with making money by doing things for other farmers. When you reach 150.000 you can request to own your own farm. (you keep that money and you will get a extra 800.000 to start with.
At the moment of writing we have 3 server and every server can hold 1 HR farm + 6 Farms.  wehn all 3 servers hve more then 4 farms on it you can chooche to sponser a new server or join on 1 of the servers that have still room. more info about Servers can be found under {Servers](https://blajakfdno.com)
