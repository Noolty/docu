# Do a Export

##What is a export?

A export in farming is a farmer selling his crops to Global Cargo


## and how can i make money on it?

As a contractor you need to check the ammounts of crops and sell them in farming.
A Export always pays you 5000 And mostly is done with in the hour so this is the most easy way to make money for you as contractor. (farmers that dont have there farm on that server can do them as well)


## How does this work?

In the discord [Farming-contractor](https://discord.com/channels/730699944918253604/1241288634217529374) channel there is a message posted when there is a new export avaible to be done or you can check [trucksweb](https://trucksweb.globalcargovtc.nl/farming/export/overview/) if there are still open exports that can be done.

Exports are always done by joining the ```Global Cargo HR Farm```
- Before you accept the export check if you see the crop and the right amount (or more) in the export building
- if its correct you can accept the export.
- then drive the ammount stated in the export to the sell point be sure your in the ```Global Cargo HR Farm```
- if you working on a export and need to go suddenly be sure to remember how much you did and keep the export open so you compleet it when your back
- When you compleet the export the export will be transport to our vtc part. And you will get payed for your work



This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```

A new document is now available at [http://localhost:3000/docs/hello](http://localhost:3000/docs/hello).

## Configure the Sidebar

Docusaurus automatically **creates a sidebar** from the `docs` folder.

Add metadata to customize the sidebar label and position:

```md title="docs/hello.md" {1-4}
---
sidebar_label: 'Hi!'
sidebar_position: 3
---

# Hello

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!
```

It is also possible to create your sidebar explicitly in `sidebars.js`:

```js title="sidebars.js"
export default {
  tutorialSidebar: [
    'intro',
    // highlight-next-line
    'hello',
    {
      type: 'category',
      label: 'Tutorial',
      items: ['tutorial-basics/create-a-document'],
    },
  ],
};
```
